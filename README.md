# ABN Javascript Assesment

#### Task:

Create a .Net 8 Application that takes data representing a 7 segment display* and identifies which number is being represented

##### 7 Segment Display Reader:

1. **Application:**
   - The data from the 7 segment display is represented by 7 numbers that can each either be 1 or 0 (on/off) for instance:
     - if the display shows a 7 the data looks like this: 1010010
     - if the display shows a 0 the data looks like: 1110111
   - For the current implementation the user needs to be able to input the numeric values and the logic then needs to return the correct number
   - **(BONUS)** Can you also make it so that the user can input a number and the logic return the data value ? 

2. **Unit Testing**
   - Write 1 or more Unit tests that proof the function algorithm is working and identifying the correct number

#### Evaluation Criteria:

- **Code Structure:** Organize your code in a clear and maintainable manner.
- **.Net/CSharp Best Practices:** Follow best practices for .Net and CSharp.
- **Error Handling:** Implement basic error handling for input values.

#### Definition

##### 7 Segment Display
Even if you haven't heard the name "seven-segment display" before, you've probably seen quite a few in your lifetime. They appear on pretty much every piece of electronic equipment that needs to display numbers for any reason, like the timer on a microwave oven, the display on a CD player, or the time on your digital wristwatch.
They're called seven-segment displays because they're actually made up of seven "segments" â€” seven individual lights (LEDs or otherwise) that light up in different patterns that represent any of the ten digits (0 - 9).
